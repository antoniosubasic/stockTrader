# Stock Trader

## Description

The Stock Trader Game is a web application that was created as a school project from [HTL Leonding](https://www.htl-leonding.at/). The goal of the project was to create a stock trading game that allows users to buy and sell stocks in real-time. The application uses the [Polygon.io](https://polygon.io/) API to get real-time stock data and display it to the user. The user can create an account, buy and sell stocks, and view their transaction history. The application also displays the user's current balance and the total value of their stock portfolio.
