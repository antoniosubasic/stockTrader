                <span class="bold">How does it work?</span> <br />
                To help you understand how the simulator functions, we've
                included a sample chart below showcasing the stock performance
                of Apple Inc. (AAPL). This chart is powered by the robust
                <a href="https://polygon.io/" target="_blank">Polygon.io</a>
                API, which provides accurate and up-to-date stock price data.
                The chart displays the closing price of the stock for each
                trading day over the last 30 days, giving you a clear view of
                its recent performance. By analyzing such charts, you can make
                informed decisions and develop effective trading strategies
                within the simulator.
